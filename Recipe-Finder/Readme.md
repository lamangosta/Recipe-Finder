This project was built in cooperation with the Louisville, Kentucky based, Code Louisville program.
As a participant in the C# class, we were asked to create a Console Application using the basic, and intermediate skills learned during the class.

The project you are about to enter is Recipe Finder. In it you will select from a choice of recipes, 
and then be returned a list of ingredients you'll need to purchase for each recipe along with the time needed to prepare each.
